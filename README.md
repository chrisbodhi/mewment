_Kinda like a mashup of Tinder and Instagram, but for cats &mdash; phase II will ~~mash in Uber~~ [this will be sort of hard to test without Uber operating in ATX right now, so phase II is up in the air `/shrug` ]_

##Running Locally
- Clone the repo using your preferred method.
  - Maybe `git clone git@github.com:chrisbodhi/mewment.git` from your command line?
- Run `npm install` in the project's root directory.
- Run `npm start` to build using Webpack and then serve up the content on port 3000.
