Kinda like a mashup of Tinder and Instagram, but for cats -- phase II will mash in Uber

###Dev Notes
- Get `.env` file and place it in your root directory
- Install webpack globally [`npm install -g webpack`] to be able to use `npm start` for development
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to run Webpack with the watch flag
